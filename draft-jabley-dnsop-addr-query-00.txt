                    draft-jabley-dnsop-addr-query-00

Abstract

   In the DNS, a single domain name can be associated with multiple
   addresses.  Each address belongs to a single address family, such as
   IPv4 or IPv6.  In the case where a name maps to addresses from
   different address families, retrieving all addresses requires
   multiple separate queries, one per address family, since the
   addresses for each address family are published separately in the DNS
   in different resource record sets, each with their own type.  This
   requires a client that wants to obtain all addresses to make multiple
   queries.

   This document describes the implementation and deployment a new, meta
   query type that allows the initiator of a query to send a single
   query and the responder to reply with the set of all IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses that exist at the query name.

1.  Introduction

   The DNS protocol [RFC1034] [RFC1035] supports the publication of
   addresses from a variety of different address families.  Addresses
   are published in RRSETs which have family-specific RRTYPEs.  Multiple
   such RRSETs can be published with the same owner name.  For example,
   the single owner name EXAMPLE.COM is associated with both an IPv4 and
   an IPv6 addreses (see {example}).

   This specification only addresses the case where the two address
   families of interest are IPv4 and IPv6.  It is common at the time of
   writing for names to have mappings to addresses of both families, and
   for software to use them interchangeably, e.g. as specified in
   [RFC6555].

Internet-Draft         The ADDR Pseudo Query Type           October 2023


   Software that wishes to obtain the full set of IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses associated with the same name must currently make two DNS
   queries, one with each QTYPE.

   This document specifies a mechanism by which a full set of IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses associated with a particular name can be obtained in a
   single query using a new meta QTYPE.

2.  Terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   "Initiator" refers to the side that sends a query.  "Responder"
   refers to an authoritative-only server, recursive resolver or other
   DNS component that receives queries and generates responses.  Other
   DNS-specific terminology is used according to the definitions to be
   found in [RFC8499].

3.  The ADDR Query Type

   This document defines the ADDR RRTYPE and specifies the manner in
   which it is used.  ADDR is a QTYPE [RFC6895] and is available for use
   with any CLASS.

3.1.  Sending ADDR Queries

   The Initiator of a query with QTYPE=ADDR does so in order to obtain a
   complete set of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with the (QNAME,
   QCLASS).  Apart from the specified QTYPE, queries are constructed and
   sent identically to queries with QTYPE=A or QTYPE=AAAA.

3.2.  Constructing and Sending ADDR Responses

   Responses are constructed as follows:

   1.  QTYPE=ADDR;

   2.  The ANSWER, AUTHORITY and ADDITIONAL sections contain the union
       of the RRSETS that the responder would include in separate
       responses generated for QTYPE=A and QTYPE=AAAA;

   3.  In all other respects responses MUST otherwise be constructed
       normally, including the use and interpretation of the DNS message
       header section flags and EDNS(0) OPT meta-RR header.

Internet-Draft         The ADDR Pseudo Query Type           October 2023


   Behaviour is intended to match handling for queries with QTYPE=ANY
   (referred to as QTYPE=* in [RFC1034]).  In particular, a responder
   that is not authoritative for the zone containing the QNAME MAY
   choose only to include data in the response that is available in a
   local cache; initiating additional queries to obtain data that is not
   cached locally in order to construct a response is OPTIONAL.

3.3.  Receiving and Interpreting Responses

   There are no special requirements for receiving and interpreting
   responses to queries with QTYPE=ADDR.

3.4.  Determining Support for Queries with QTYPE=ADDR

   Initiators MAY choose to send test queries with QTYPE=ADDR to
   particular nameservers in order to determine whether the
   corresponding functionality is available, and may record what it
   finds out in a local cache in order to determine whether subsequently
   to initiate queries with QTYPE=ADDR or to initiate queries with
   QTYPE=A and QTYPE=AAAA.

   Nameservers are often provisioned in a distributed manner, e.g. using
   anycast [RFC4786] where multiple, autonomous origin servers handle
   queries equivalently using the same nameserver address.  Where such
   nameservers are configured to support queries with QTYPE=ADDR, it
   should be ensured that all origin servers associated with the same
   nameserver address provide consistent support.

3.5.  Example

   The following three examples illustrate queries with the same QNAME
   with QTYPEs A, AAAA and ADDR.  Each example is provided in the form
   of output from the common DNS troubleshooting tool "dig" as packaged
   with the DNS nameserver BIND9.  Some lines have been truncated to
   improve readability.  The example with QTYPE=ADDR is contrived since
   at the time of writing the nameservers concerned do not support this
   specification.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification describes a new meta QTYPE which causes DNS
   responses to be generated that are larger than if QTYPE=A or
   QTYPE=AAAA were used.  This provides some amplification potential,
   although it is modest and in a practical sense much less severe than
   with QTYPE=ANY.

   In the case of QTYPE=ANY the amplification potential was very large
   without needing to contrive particular owner names in the DNS, e.g.
   due to the common practice of stacking many RRSETS with significant
   RDATA at the zone apex.  Some operators choose to address these risks
   by providing minimal responses to queries with QTYPE=ANY, as
   described in [RFC8482].

   In the case of QTYPE=ANY, only RRSETS of type A and AAAA are able to
   contribute to the amplification.  The size of the corresponding RDATA
   for these RRs is fixed and relatively small.  While it is not unusual
   for multiple RRs of type A and AAAA to be associated with a single
   owner name, in practice the total size of such RRSETS is dramatically
   smaller than the zone apex example alluded to above.

   A nameserver operator that is concerned about the amplification
   potential of this specification can simply choose not to implement
   it.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has allocated the code point TBA1 for QTYPE ADDR and
   recorded it in the Resource Record (RR) TYPEs sub-registry of the DNS
   Parameters registry as follows:

   +======+=======+===============+===============+===================+
   | TYPE | Value | Reference     | Template      | Registration Date |
   +======+=======+===============+===============+===================+
   | TBA1 | ADDR  | This document | See Section 6 | As appropriate    |
   +------+-------+---------------+---------------+-------------------+

                                 Table 1

   The IANA has updated the "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG Module to
   reflect this registration, as described in [RFC9108].

6.  Template

   The following template was submitted to request support of RRTYPE
   TBA1 as described in this document.

   A.  Submission Date: (date of this document)

   B.1 Submission Type: [X] New RRTYPE [ ] Modification to RRTYPE B.2
   Kind of RR: [ ] Data RR [X] Meta-RR

   Assignment of a QTYPE from the range of code-points reserved for "Q
   and Meta-TYPEs" is requested; see [RFC6895] section 3.1.1.

   C.  Contact Information for submitter (will be publicly posted):

   The author contact information for this document may be used as the
   contact information for this template.

   D.  Motivation for the new RRTYPE application Please keep this part
   at a high level to inform the Expert and reviewers about uses of the
   RRTYPE.  Most reviewers will be DNS experts that may have limited
   knowledge of your application space.

   See Section 1.

   E.  Description of the proposed RR type.  This description can be
   provided in-line in the template, as an attachment, or with a
   publicly available URL.

   See Section 3.

   F.  What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that need
   and why are they unsatisfactory?

   The RRTYPEs A and AAAA provide a means of publishing IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses in the DNS.  However, in order to obtain all IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses for a particular owner name, two queries are required.
   This specification allows the same functionality with a single query.

   The RRTYPE ANY (referred to as * in [RFC1035] provide a means of
   obtaining all RRTYPEs associated with a single owner name in a single
   query.  However, queries with QTYPE=ANY provide unacceptable
   amplification potential for some operators and in many cases their
   use has been curtailed, e.g. see [RFC8482].

   G.  What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

   ADDR

   H.  Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA registry
   or require the creation of a new IANA subregistry in DNS Parameters?
   If so, please indicate which registry is to be used or created.  If a
   new subregistry is needed, specify the allocation policy for it and
   its initial contents.  Also include what the modification procedures
   will be.

   No.

   I.  Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS servers/
   resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed as an
   unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597]?

   Yes.
