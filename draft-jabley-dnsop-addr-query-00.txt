                    draft-jabley-dnsop-addr-query-00

Abstract

   In the DNS, a single domain name can be associated with multiple
   addresses.  Each address belongs to a single address family, such as
   IPv4 or IPv6.  In the case where a name maps to addresses from
   different address families, retrieving all addresses requires
   multiple separate queries, one per address family, since the
   addresses for each address family are published separately in the DNS
   in different resource record sets, each with their own type.  This
   requires a client that wants to obtain all addresses to make multiple
   queries.

   This document describes the implementation and deployment a new, meta
   query type that allows the initiator of a query to send a single
   query and the responder to reply with the set of all IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses that exist at the query name.

1.  Introduction

   The DNS protocol [RFC1034] [RFC1035] supports the publication of
   addresses from a variety of different address families.  Addresses
   are published in RRSETs which have family-specific RRTYPEs.  Multiple
   such RRSETs can be published with the same owner name.  For example,
   the single owner name EXAMPLE.COM is associated with both an IPv4 and
   an IPv6 addresses (see {example}).

   This specification only addresses the case where the two address
   families of interest are IPv4 and IPv6.  It is common at the time of
   writing for names to have mappings to addresses of both families, and
   for software to use them interchangeably, e.g. as specified in
   [RFC6555].

Internet-Draft         The ADDR Pseudo Query Type           October 2023


   Software that wishes to obtain the full set of IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses associated with the same name must currently make two DNS
   queries, one with each QTYPE.

   This document specifies a mechanism by which a full set of IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses associated with a particular name can be obtained in a
   single query using a new meta QTYPE.

2.  Terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   "Initiator" refers to the side that sends a query.  "Responder"
   refers to an authoritative-only server, recursive resolver or other
   DNS component that receives queries and generates responses.  Other
   DNS-specific terminology is used according to the definitions to be
   found in [RFC8499].

3.  The ADDR Query Type

   This document defines the ADDR RRTYPE and specifies the manner in
   which it is used.  ADDR is a QTYPE [RFC6895] and is available for use
   with any CLASS.

3.1.  Sending ADDR Queries

   The Initiator of a query with QTYPE=ADDR does so in order to obtain a
   complete set of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with the (QNAME,
   QCLASS).  Apart from the specified QTYPE, queries are constructed and
   sent identically to queries with QTYPE=A or QTYPE=AAAA.

3.2.  Constructing and Sending ADDR Responses

   Responses are constructed as follows:

   1.  QTYPE=ADDR;

   2.  The ANSWER, AUTHORITY and ADDITIONAL sections contain the union
       of the RRSETS that the responder would include in separate
       responses generated for QTYPE=A and QTYPE=AAAA;

   3.  In all other respects responses MUST otherwise be constructed
       normally, including the use and interpretation of the DNS message
       header section flags and EDNS(0) OPT meta-RR header.

Internet-Draft         The ADDR Pseudo Query Type           October 2023


   A responder that is not authoritative for the zone containing the
   QNAME (e.g.  a responder acting as a recursive resolver) that is not
   able to construct a response exclusively from cached records MUST
   send upstream queries in order for its response to be complete, just
   as it would when responding to queries with QTYPE=A or QTYPE=AAAA
   that could not be satisfied from the cache.

   Where an owner name has either associated A or AAAA RRSETS but not
   both and a query has requested a secure response with DO=1, the
   response MUST include the proof of the non-existence of the missing
   RRSET, e.g. by including a signed NSEC RR in the AUTHORITY section of
   the response that confirms the absence of the missing RRTYPE at the
   QNAME.  This follows from (2) above.

3.3.  Receiving and Interpreting Responses

   There are no special requirements for receiving and interpreting
   responses to queries with QTYPE=ADDR.

3.4.  Discovering Support for QTYPE=ADDR in Responders

   Initiators SHOULD support local configuration that allows support for
   particular responders to be specified based on knowledge of their
   capabilities, for example where the initiator and responder are part
   of a larger system and maintained by a common operator.

   Initiators MAY also implement a discovery mechanism that allows
   support in responders about which there is no local policy to be
   inferred.  The following mechanism is provided as an illustration of
   a possible mechanism that could be used.  Implementors MAY use
   different mechanisms.

   1.  An initiator maintains a cache of capabilities for DNS
       responders.  At startup this cache is empty.

   2.  An initiator of a query for QTYPE=A or QTYPE=AAAA to a responder
       that is known from the cache to be capable uses QTYPE=ADDR to
       send the upstream query.

   3.  If the capabilities of the responder are not known from the
       cache, the initiator sends both QTYPE=A and QTYPE=AAAA and, in
       parallel, QTYPE=ADDR.  If all three queries generate responses
       and the responses are compatible, the initiator adds the
       responder address and a timestamp to the cache.

   4.  A responder included in the cache with a timestamp that is too
       old to be considered current will no longer be considered
       current, and the discovery mechanism should be repeated.  The

       threshold beyond which an entry should no longer be considered
       current is a matter of local policy, and may be refined over time
       following observation of caches in real-world operation.

   Nameservers (responders) are often provisioned in a distributed
   manner, e.g.  using anycast [RFC4786] where multiple, autonomous
   origin servers handle queries equivalently using the same nameserver
   address.  Where such nameservers are configured to support queries
   with QTYPE=ADDR, it should be ensured that all origin servers
   associated with the same nameserver address provide consistent
   support.

3.5.  Example

   The following three examples illustrate queries with the same QNAME
   with QTYPEs A, AAAA and ADDR.  Each example is provided in the form
   of output from the common DNS troubleshooting tool "dig" as packaged
   with the DNS nameserver BIND9.  Some lines have been truncated to
   improve readability.  The example with QTYPE=ADDR is contrived since
   at the time of writing the nameservers concerned do not support this
   specification.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification describes a new meta QTYPE which causes DNS
   responses to be generated that are larger than if QTYPE=A or
   QTYPE=AAAA were used.  This provides some amplification potential,
   although it is modest and in a practical sense much less severe than
   with QTYPE=ANY.

   In the case of QTYPE=ANY the amplification potential was very large
   without needing to contrive particular owner names in the DNS, e.g.
   due to the common practice of stacking many RRSETS with significant
   RDATA at the zone apex.  Some operators choose to address these risks
   by providing minimal responses to queries with QTYPE=ANY, as
   described in [RFC8482].

   In the case of QTYPE=ANY, only RRSETS of type A and AAAA are able to
   contribute to the amplification.  The size of the corresponding RDATA
   for these RRs is fixed and relatively small.  While it is not unusual
   for multiple RRs of type A and AAAA to be associated with a single
   owner name, in practice the total size of such RRSETS is dramatically
   smaller than the zone apex example alluded to above.

   A nameserver operator that is concerned about the amplification
   potential of this specification can simply choose not to implement
   it.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has allocated the code point TBA1 for QTYPE ADDR from the
   range of available code-points designated for use by "Q and Meta-
   TYPEs" [RFC6895] and recorded it in the Resource Record (RR) TYPEs
   sub-registry of the DNS Parameters registry as follows:

   +======+=======+===============+================+===================+
   | TYPE | Value | Reference     | Template       | Registration Date |
   +======+=======+===============+================+===================+
   | TBA1 | ADDR  | This document | See            | As appropriate    |
   |      |       |               | Appendix A     |                   |
   +------+-------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+

                                  Table 1

   The IANA has updated the "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG Module to
   reflect this registration, as described in [RFC9108].

6.  Acknowledgements

   This is not the first attempt to specify some kind of multi-QTYPEs
   functionality.  The bravery and foolish optimism of all those that
   came before is hereby acknowledged.

   An early implementation of this mechanism was implemented in
   authoritative-only DNS servers by Olafur Gudmundsson, Christian
   Elmerot and Pavel Odintsov at Cloudflare starting around 2016, using
   the private-use code-point 65535 for ADDR.

      This description can be provided in-line in the template, as an
      attachment, or with a publicly available URL.

      See draft-jabley-dnsop-addr-query-00 section 3.

   F. What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that need
      and why are they unsatisfactory?

      The RRTYPEs A and AAAA provide a means of publishing IPv4

      and IPv6 addresses in the DNS. However, in order to obtain
      all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for a particular owner name, two
      queries are required.  This specification allows the same
      functionality with a single query.

      The RRTYPE ANY (referred to as * in RFC 1035) provides a
      means of obtaining all RRTYPEs associated with a single owner
      name in a single query. However, queries with QTYPE=ANY
      provide unacceptable amplification potential for some operators
      and in many cases their use has been curtailed, e.g. see
      RFC 8482.

   G. What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

      Note: If a mnemonic is not supplied, not allowed, or duplicates an
      existing RRTYPE or CLASS mnemonic, the Expert will assign a
      mnemonic.

      ADDR

   H. Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA registry
      or require the creation of a new IANA subregistry in DNS
      Parameters?  If so, please indicate which registry is to be used
      or created.  If a new subregistry is needed, specify the
      allocation policy for it and its initial contents.  Also include
      what the modification procedures will be.

      No.

   I. Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
      servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed
      as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?

      No.
